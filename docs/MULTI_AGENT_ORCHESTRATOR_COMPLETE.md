  "options": {
    "threadId": "optional_thread_id"
  }
}
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "query": "Analyze Hamilton's 2023 performance...",
  "response": "Comprehensive multi-agent analysis...",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "metadata": {
    "queryType": "driver_analysis",
    "agentsUsed": ["driver", "championship", "historical"],
    "agentsFailed": [],
    "complexity": "complex",
    "executionTime": "2025-06-11T12:51:59.802Z",

```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Simple Queries** → Single agent execution
2. **Complex Queries** → Multi-agent parallel execution
3. **Interdependent Queries** → Sequential agent execution
4. **Failed Agents** → Graceful degradation with partial results

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Successful Test Execution

- **Response Time**: ~11 seconds for complex multi-agent query
- **Agent Coordination**: 3 agents executed (1 successful, 2 expected failures)
- **Synthesis Quality**: 4,827 character comprehensive response
- **Confidence Score**: 70% (single agent) to 90% (multi-agent bonus)
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms working

### Agent Health Status

```
Total agents: 5
Healthy agents: 5
- season: healthy
- driver: healthy
- race: healthy
- championship: healthy
- historical: healthy
```
